An API that provides an abstraction layer between the three main Minecraft mod loaders (Fabric, Forge, and Quilt). It is meant to be used with a multi-loader development environment such as Jared's [MultiLoader-Template](https://github.com/jaredlll08/MultiLoader-Template).

Documentation will be available in the near future.

Pull requests are highly appreciated. However, please discuss the in my [Discord](https://discord.gg/aqXkvbJ) first and while developing them.
