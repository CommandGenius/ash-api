An API that provides an abstraction layer between the APIs of the main Minecraft mod loaders: (Neo)Forge and Fabric. It is meant to be used with a multi-loader development environment such as Jared's [MultiLoader-Template](https://github.com/jaredlll08/MultiLoader-Template).

Documentation will be available in the near future.
